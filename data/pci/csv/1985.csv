Two-hundred-forty-four members of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentuckywere killed in the accident. There is controversy surrounding this crash. The majority opinion of the board was that the cause of the sequence leading up to the stall and crash could not be determined, with icing a possibility. The minority opinion was that the crash was possibly caused by detonation of an explosive device of unknown origin in a cargo compartment which led to an in-flight fire and loss of control of the aircraft."

The fire most likely started in a defective cabin heater but was not determined for sure. Singer Rick Nelson, 45, fianc√©e Helen Blair, 27, soundman Clark Russell and the members of his back-up group The Stone Canyon Band, Andy Chapin, 20, Rick Intveld, 22, Bobby Neal, 38, and Patrick Woodward, 35 were killed. Both pilots survived after climbing out the cockpit windows. Nelson had purchased the DC-3 in May 1985 from Jerry Lee Lewis and the craft had been forced to make two emergency landings in the previous six months. Nelson and his band were en route to perform at the half-time festivities at the Cotton Bowl."
