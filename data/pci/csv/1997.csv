The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilots left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the planes right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank.
